# hello-world
First Repository

Hello, my name is Torry. I am a graduate of the University of Louisiana-Lafayette's Informatics program. I am currently a Technical Services Analyst at Louisiana CAT. Reasoning for joining github is to practice aspects of IT that I am currently not using at my current employer. IT is always evolving and I plan on staying up to date!
